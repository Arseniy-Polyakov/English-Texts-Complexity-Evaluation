I like winter because I have long winter holidays. They start on the 29th of December and last till the 10th of January.
The weather is usually fine. There is a lot of snow everywhere.
During winter holidays I have a lot of free time. I don’t have to get up early and go to school. I like to skate and ski.
Sometimes I go to my country house and meet my friends there. We spend a lot of time in the open air, go to the forest, build snowcastles and play snowballs. If it is cold, I usually stay at home. I read books, watch TV or play computer games.
Also I like my winter holidays because we have a happy day – New Year’s Day on the 1st of January and I get presents.
Sometimes my parents and I travel during winter holidays. Last year we visited Suzdal. We stayed in a hotel for three days. I saw many places of interest in Suzdal: wooden houses, beautiful churches and monasteries. It was a very impressive trip.
I like my winter holidays very much.
